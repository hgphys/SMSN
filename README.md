# SMSN
## Stochastic Model Simulator on Networks
SMSN is a python module to estimate the firm size in a production network based on [Bouchaud-Mezard model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437100002053?via%3Dihub).
This simulator based on BM model is applicable for undirected network or strongly connected part of directed network.
The program uses [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html).

We apply this simulator for Japanese production network to estimate the asset distribution.
Our paper "Practicality evaluation of stochastic model on networks for the real economy simulation" is published in [Journal of Computational Social Science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs42001-019-00029-9).
